```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
```

## Import the data

```{r}
# If you are testing this outside my repo, please change the url
data_url <- "~/R/delfina-ds-interview/data/birthdata2020.csv"
birth_data <- read.csv(data_url, header = TRUE)
```

## Task 1:  What is the proportion of births by gestational age at delivery
I am answering this question as the proportion of births at each one of the combined gestation weeks based on the column COMBGEST.

Given that COMBGEST uses the value 99 as a filler value to denote missing data I will remove that value. 
I am also filtering the data to limit the results to values between 20 and 50 weeks, that range was selected based on information found [here](https://www.health.ny.gov/community/pregnancy/why_is_40_weeks_so_important.htm#:~:text=How%20long%20is%20full%20term%3F).

```{r}
birth_data %>% 
  filter(COMBGEST %in% (20:50)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(COMBGEST))+
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), fill = 'blue') +
  theme_classic()+
  xlab("Number of weeks at birth")+
  ylab("Proportion of births")
```
<br>
As we can see, the largest proportion of births occur between 39 and 41 weeks of gestation.


## Task 2:  What is the prevalence of preterm birth in this dataset?
To answer this question I will create a flag variable (is_preterm) to indicate if the birth occurred prior to 37 weeks of gestation (based on COMBGEST). In order to better calculate the proportion of preterm birth that occurred during 2020, I will exclude those cases where COMBGEST =99
```{r}
birth_data %>% 
  filter(COMBGEST<99) %>% 
  mutate(is_preterm = case_when(
    COMBGEST < 37 ~ "Yes",
    TRUE ~ "No"
  )) %>% 
  group_by(is_preterm) %>% 
  summarise(n_cases = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = 100* round(n_cases / sum(n_cases), 4)) %>% 
  data.table()

```

We can see that from all the observations in the dataset, less than 12% of the cases are preterm births.

## Tast 3: Summarizes the relationship between preterm birth and the following four variables:

  - Maternal age (MAGER)

  - Maternal race/Hispanic origin (MRACEHISP)

  - Previous preterm birth (RF_PPTERM)

  - Total number of prenatal visits (PREVIS)


## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressurech, eo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
